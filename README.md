# analogclock
Javascript Analog Clock with lots of nice looking features. This draws on the canvas element and is CSS free.

This was a project I started a while back. Saw a nice simple HTML5 Analog Clock and decided to make it nicer.
This uses NO CSS, draws on the HTML5 Canvas element and support a bunch of options.

The analogclock.html is a simple demo page that loads analogclock.js

The idea was to support multiple clocks on a page. 

Some open issues are general code clean/refactor. Options and presets are clunky but I don't know enough about JS to do it right.

Enjoy and please follow my licensing to the letter (see source).

If you have and ideas or fixes send me a message, happy to fix and enhance.
